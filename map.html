Framed within Israel's Periphery Doctrine, which aimed to form alliances with non-Arab groups and states to counter Arab hostility, this relationship, despite moments of alignment, has ultimately been characterized by disappointment and unfulfilled potential.</p>                <p>The foundation for Israeli-Maronite relations was laid in the early 20th century, driven by mutual concerns over their vulnerability in the Arab-dominated Middle East. In 1920, Zionist and Maronite activists signed an agreement that recognized the Jews' right to establish a national home in Palestine in exchange for the recognition of an independent Christian Lebanon separate from Syria. This early cooperation reflected their shared aspirations for autonomy and their desire to avoid Arab and Muslim dominance in the region. The relationship was further solidified in 1946 when the Maronite Church and the Jewish Agency signed a treaty emphasizing cooperation based on the principle of "isolation from and hostility towards their Arab-Muslim surroundings."</p>                <p>However, by the mid-1930s, the Maronite political orientation began to shift with the rise of the concept of "Greater Lebanon." Promoted by figures such as Bishara al-Khuri, this idea advocated for Lebanonâ€™s integration into the Arab world, emphasizing coexistence with the Muslim population and forging closer ties with neighboring Arab countries. As the Maronite leadership increasingly embraced this vision, their stance toward Israel shifted, and they began to adopt a policy of neutrality or even hostility, particularly in relation to the Arab-Israeli conflict. This realignment was motivated by the Maronites' need to maintain internal stability in Lebanon, preserve the principles of the "National Charter," and avoid alienating their Muslim counterparts within the country.</p>                <p>Despite these shifts, there were still significant points of cooperation between Israel and certain Maronite factions, particularly during periods of shared concern. In the 1958 Lebanese Civil War, Israel intervened to support the Maronite-led Kataeb Party, seeing an opportunity to counter the influence of Arab nationalist forces within Lebanon. In the 1970s, as the Lebanese Civil War escalated, Israel rekindled its ties with the Maronites, especially those affiliated with the Lebanese Front. Both Israel and the Maronites felt increasingly threatened by the growing influence of Palestinian armed groups and the potential for Syrian intervention in Lebanon.</p>                <p>The most pivotal moment in Israeli-Maronite relations came in 1982, with the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, codenamed "Operation Peace for Galilee." Initially framed as a military operation to eliminate Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) bases in southern Lebanon, the invasion was also motivated by Israel's longstanding vision of a Maronite-dominated state in Lebanon aligned with its interests. Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, developed close ties with Maronite leader Bachir Gemayel, who was elected President of Lebanon with Israeli support. However, the operation ultimately proved disastrous for Israelâ€™s Periphery Doctrine. Gemayel was assassinated before he could assume office, and Israel's prolonged occupation of Lebanon, marked by the Sabra and Shatila massacre, generated widespread condemnation. The invasion failed to achieve Israelâ€™s strategic goals and led to disillusionment with the Maronites, who were blamed for dragging Israel into an unnecessary war.</p>                <p>The aftermath of the 1982 invasion marked the end of the policy of the "Minorities Alliance." Israelâ€™s disillusionment with the Maronites grew, as the war was viewed by many as a failure and the Maronites were blamed for Israel's entanglement in Lebanon. The complexities of Lebanese politics, the rise of Hezbollah, and the unintended consequences of Israelâ€™s military actions contributed to the unraveling of this relationship. Despite Israelâ€™s strategic interest in establishing a "Christian Lebanon," which remained a point of national consensus, the debate shifted from supporting the Maronites to blaming them for Israelâ€™s perceived failure in Lebanon. The Maronite-Israeli alliance, once seen as a natural fit, was ultimately unable to overcome the challenges of Lebanese politics and the broader regional dynamics, marking another example of the Periphery Doctrine's limitations in fostering lasting alliances in the Middle East.</p>            </div>            </div>`)[0];

Rooted in ancient ties, the Jewish and Persian peoples shared a notable cultural and historical affinity. Persian King Cyrus the Great, celebrated in Jewish tradition for liberating Jews from Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE, laid the foundation for a relationship marked by mutual respect. Persian lands later became a center for flourishing Jewish communities.</p>                <p>The 20th century ushered in a period of strategic cooperation between Israel and Iran. Under the Shah, Israel and Iranâ€™s partnership flourished, marked by robust military, intelligence, and economic cooperation. Shared concerns over pan-Arabism, led by Egyptâ€™s Gamal Abdel Nasser, and the Soviet Unionâ€™s regional ambitions drove this partnership. Iran became a cornerstone of Israelâ€™s policy of periphery.</p>                <p>Israel provided Iran with advanced weaponry, including Gabriel missiles and communication systems, and trained the SAVAK, Iranâ€™s secret police. Intelligence-sharing focused on regional threats like Egypt, Iraq, and communist movements. Economically, Iran was a vital market for Israeli arms and a critical alternative oil supplier during crises such as the 1973 oil embargo. The partnership extended to supporting Kurdish insurgents in northern Iraq, a move aimed at weakening Iraqâ€”a mutual adversaryâ€”and preventing its alignment with Arab forces against Israel. These efforts underscored a pragmatic, mutually beneficial alliance.</p>                <p>The 1979 Islamic Revolution, however, marked a turning point, replacing the Shahâ€™s regime with Ayatollah Ali Khomeiniâ€™s theocratic government. The new regime declared Israel an enemy, framing its ideology around anti-Zionism and transforming Iran from a key ally into a primary regional adversary. This ideological shift was further underscored by Iranâ€™s support for groups like Hezbollah and its pursuit of strategies aimed at undermining Israelâ€™s security.</p>                <p>Despite the deep animosity, a pragmatic episode occurred during the Iran-Iraq War (1980â€“1988) with the Iran-Contra Affair. Israel covertly supplied arms to Iran, mediated by the United States, in a bid to weaken Iraq. However, this cooperation was fleeting, and the underlying hostility persisted. Iranâ€™s subsequent "Ring of Fire" strategy, involving proxy forces and missile bases encircling Israel, has escalated tensions. The Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab states, have further alarmed Tehran, heightening regional competition.</p>                <p>This intricate history, from ancient kinship to modern enmity, highlights the volatility of geopolitics in the Middle East and the goal of the Periphery Doctrine. Once a strategic partnership shaped by Cold War dynamics, Israeli-Iranian relations now epitomize the enduring impact of ideological divides and regional rivalries.</p>            </div>            </div>`)[0];

However, its relationship with Israel during the early years of Ben-Gurion's Periphery Doctrine was cautious and complex. While Turkey shared Israelâ€™s concerns over regional threats such as pan-Arabism under Egyptâ€™s Gamal Abdel Nasser, its engagement in the Periphery Doctrine was less enthusiastic than that of Iran or Ethiopia. Turkey's relatively warmer relations with Arab states, reliance on Arab oil, and access to American aid through NATO membership contributed to its measured approach.</p>                <p>Despite this caution, shared strategic concerns fostered collaboration between Turkey and Israel. Syria's territorial claims on southern Turkey, the Soviet-Syrian Treaty of 1957, and Nasserâ€™s growing regional influence drove Turkey closer to Israel. The late 1950s saw a series of covert meetings between Israeli and Turkish officials, including a top-secret visit by Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to meet Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes. These efforts led to the elevation of Turkish-Israeli diplomatic relations, culminating in the establishment of a Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv by 1980.</p>                <p>Turkeyâ€™s strategic alliance with Israel was balanced against its public sensitivity to the Palestinian issue. Events such as the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980 and the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism in 1975 prompted Turkey to maintain a cautious public stance. Nonetheless, the alliance yielded significant military, economic, and security benefits for both countries. For Israel, this relationship became even more critical following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which removed a key Periphery Doctrine partner.</p>                <p>The rise of Turkeyâ€™s Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2002 marked a sharp decline in Turkish-Israeli relations. The AKP's Islamist-leaning policies, coupled with the diminishing influence of Turkeyâ€™s militaryâ€”a staunch supporter of the alliance with Israelâ€”reshaped the bilateral dynamic. Under AKP leadership, Turkey distanced itself from Israel, adopting a more critical stance on the Palestinian issue. Ankaraâ€™s condemnation of Israeli actions in Gaza, its support for Hamas, and strained diplomatic relations, including incidents like the 2010 Mavi Marmara flotilla confrontation, underscored the end of the strategic partnership.</p>                <p>The robust alliance fostered during the Periphery Doctrine era gradually dissolved as Turkey aligned its foreign policy with new ideological and regional priorities. While the AKPâ€™s tenure has been marked by significant tension, the early decades of Turkish-Israeli relations remain a significant example of Ben-Gurion's strategy to forge alliances with non-Arab states to counter regional isolation.</p>            </div>            </div>`)[0];

Both Israel and Ethiopia, a predominantly Christian nation, felt threatened by the rising tide of pan-Arabism and socialist expansion, particularly the influence of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Their common fear of "Arab nationalism" and the potential for Islamic unity in the Horn of Africa, where both countries had significant Muslim populations, further united their interests.</p>                <p>Strategically, Ethiopiaâ€™s control of the Red Sea coastline made it an invaluable ally to Israel, especially in terms of maritime security. The Red Sea was a vital trade route for Israel, and Ethiopia's position provided Israel with critical access. Additionally, Ethiopia served as a conduit for Israeli assistance to South Sudanese rebels and played a key role in the rise of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, further demonstrating its geopolitical importance.</p>                <p>The relationship was also shaped by historical and cultural ties. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, who regarded himself as the "Lion of Judah," felt a deep historical connection to Israel, rooted in the Ethiopian narrative that linked the countryâ€™s Solomonic dynasty to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. This shared legacy of Jewish heritage strengthened the diplomatic bonds between the two nations, leading to the establishment of formal relations in 1956.</p>                <p>Israel and Ethiopiaâ€™s relationship developed into a "special relationship," marked by extensive cooperation in various sectors. Militarily, Israel provided significant support, including military training for Ethiopian forces, especially during the Eritrean rebellion and the Ogaden Warâ€”both of which were supported by Arab states. Israel also assisted Ethiopia with economic and technical cooperation, working on projects such as developing the countryâ€™s blood bank, ports, and fisheries. Additionally, Ethiopia played a crucial role in Israel's airlifting of Ethiopian Jews during Operations Moses and Solomon, allowing thousands of Ethiopian Jews to immigrate to Israel.</p>                <p>Despite changes in the political landscape, Ethiopia largely refrained from following the broader African trend of severing ties with Israel. Even in 1973, when Ethiopia did break off diplomatic relations, it was more a pragmatic move to align with the African bloc rather than a reflection of hostility towards Israel. Ethiopia abstained from UN General Assembly Resolution 3379, which equated Zionism with racism, unlike many other African nations. Even after the Marxist Derg regime came to power in 1974, Ethiopia continued discreet engagement with Israel, highlighting the continued strategic importance of the relationship.</p>                <p>The enduring cooperation between Israel and Ethiopia is a testament to the principles of the Periphery Doctrine. It demonstrates how Israel built alliances based on shared security concerns, leveraged strategic partnerships to break regional isolation, and gained access to critical resources and intelligence. The Israeli-Ethiopian alliance, even in the face of shifting geopolitical dynamics, underscores the enduring relevance of the Periphery Doctrine and its role in navigating the complexities of Middle Eastern and African geopolitics.</p>            </div>            </div>`)[0];

Both groups share a history of persecution by common adversaries, particularly Arab nationalists and extremist regimes. For instance, Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, known for its hostility toward Israel, also perpetrated genocide against the Kurds. Similarly, Hafez Assad's regime in Syria denied citizenship and basic rights to many Kurds, while Iranâ€™s ayatollahs systematically suppressed Kurdish dissidents. This shared experience of repression forged a natural bond between the two peoples, united in their desire for self-determination and security.</p>         <p>The genesis of Israeli-Kurdish relations can be traced back to the 1960s, following the outbreak of the Kurdish rebellion against the Iraqi government in 1961. This marked the beginning of a growing alliance, rooted in Israel's Periphery Doctrine, which sought to build partnerships with non-Arab states and groups in the Middle East to counter the Arab opposition to Israel. The Kurds, with their longstanding insurgency against the Iraqi governmentâ€”a staunch supporter of anti-Israeli policiesâ€”offered Israel a valuable opportunity for cooperation. Additionally, the Kurdish movement had limited ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) active in Turkey, reducing the risk of significant diplomatic fallout for Israel from Turkey or the United States.</p>         <p>The relationship began in earnest when Ismet Sherif Vanli, a Kurdish activist, visited Israel with the approval of Mustafa Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). During his visit, Vanli met with Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol and Shimon Peres, then-head of the Labor Party. This visit laid the groundwork for deeper cooperation. Following this, Israeli support expanded in several key areas, including military training, humanitarian aid, and logistical assistance. Israeli military commanders were sent to Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Iraq to train the Peshmerga forces, and field hospitals were set up to provide medical support. Israel also facilitated connections for the Kurds with the outside world and gathered intelligence on Iraqi military movements.</p>         <p>One of the most significant instances of Israeli assistance came during the Battle of Ali Beg Waterfall in 1965-1966, where Israeli Lieutenant Colonel Tsuri Sagay devised a successful defensive strategy for the Kurdish forces, who were vastly outnumbered by the Iraqi army. This cooperation, which included training Kurdish officers in Israel, marked a high point in Israeli-Kurdish relations and demonstrated the effectiveness of their military collaboration.</p>         <p>However, this alliance faced a setback in 1975 with the signing of the Algiers Accord between the Shah of Iran and Saddam Hussein. Under this agreement, Iran ceased its support for the Kurdish rebellion in exchange for territorial concessions from Iraq. As a result, Iranian support for the Kurds was withdrawn, and Israeli advisors were forced to leave Iraq. The Kurdish rebellion was crushed, leading to a sense of betrayal among the Kurds. Despite this, the shared history of cooperation and mutual interests laid the foundation for the eventual re-emergence of ties in the post-Saddam era.</p>         <p>The relationship between Israel and the Kurds was revived after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, as the Kurds established a de facto state in northern Iraq. Leaders like Masoud Barzani openly advocated for diplomatic relations with Israel, and Kurdish officials, such as Jalal Talabani, publicly embraced Israeli counterparts. Despite facing significant oppositionâ€”such as the 2017 Kurdish independence referendum, during which the display of Israeli flags by Kurdish supporters was used by Iran and Turkey to stoke anti-Kurdish sentimentâ€”the bond between Israel and the Kurds remains resilient. This relationship continues to reflect mutual security interests and shared aspirations for stability and recognition in a region fraught with complex geopolitical challenges.</p>         <p>Despite the obstacles, the enduring ties between Israel and the Kurds remain rooted in their shared history of persecution and a mutual commitment to self-determination. As both groups continue to navigate a complex and volatile regional landscape, their alliance serves as a testament to the lasting relevance of Israelâ€™s Periphery Doctrine.</p>     </div>     </div>`)[0];

Faced with isolation in a hostile region, the doctrine sought to counterbalance the Arab bloc by forging alliances with non-Arab and non-Muslim states, as well as with minority groups in the Middle East. These alliances were designed to break the unity of Israelâ€™s adversaries, reduce its diplomatic and economic isolation, and secure critical resources and intelligence.</p>         <p>Key allies under the Periphery Doctrine included Ethiopia, Iran (under the Shah), Turkey, Lebanese Christians, and the Kurds. Ethiopia's Christian identity and strategic location on the Red Sea made it a valuable partner, providing Israel with access to South Sudanese rebels and facilitating the evacuation of Ethiopian Jews through Operations Moses and Solomon. Iran, sharing Israel's opposition to Egyptian President Nasser's Pan-Arabism, cooperated in areas such as oil, trade, and military support. Turkey, concerned about Soviet and Syrian influence, developed strategic ties with Israel, including military and intelligence collaboration. Lebanese Christians, due to their proximity and shared minority status, were seen as potential partners, with Israel even contemplating support for a Christian state in Lebanon. Similarly, Israel cultivated ties with the Kurdish resistance, recognizing their struggle against Arab-dominated governments as a shared interest.</p>         <p>These alliances aimed to weaken Arab unity, secure vital resources like oilâ€”particularly crucial during the 1973 oil crisisâ€”and enhance Israelâ€™s intelligence capabilities. For example, support for the Iraqi Kurds provided insights into the military and political dynamics of hostile neighboring states. Despite its initial successes, the doctrine faced significant setbacks, such as the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, which transformed a key ally into a hostile regime, and the rise of Turkeyâ€™s pro-Islamic AKP in 2002, straining previously strong ties.</p>         <p>Nonetheless, the Periphery Doctrineâ€™s underlying principles remain relevant. Israel's renewed engagement with Iraqi Kurds since 2003, including support for Kurdish independence and oil trade, illustrates its ongoing strategy of building alliances based on shared security concerns and mutual interests. The Israeli-Kurdish relationship, rooted in common experiences of persecution and aspirations for self-determination, exemplifies the doctrineâ€™s enduring utility in navigating the region's complex geopolitical landscape. These clandestine alliances continue to underscore the value of partnerships aimed at fostering stability and countering mutual threats.</p>     </div>     </div>`)[0];
